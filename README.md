OK! So this is the first app I've ever made so I'm making my excuses early!!
And I'm not going to pretend that ChatGPT didn't do most the work.

Basically the app works like this:

For the Shot watcher (there are 2 per game):

1. Pick the duration of the periods for the game (this changes for different age groups)
2. Pick which team are in the goal you're looking at at the start of the game.
3. Hit 'Start Game'
4. The next step is to add the shirt number of the first goalie on the ice and hit 'Start Period'
5. Once you've done that you start tracking the shots on target and the goals
   (You can see the live tally of shots and goals for the keeper)
6. [Optional] If the team switch goalies:
   6a. Click the 'Switch Goalie' button
   6b. Add the new goalies shirt number
   6c. Add the time as it appears on the game clock.
   6d. Click 'Confirm Switch,
7.Repeat 5 and 6 until the period ends.
8. At the end of the period hit 'Next Period' - this automatically toggles the team between 'home and 'away' (as the teams switch ends)
9. This loops you back to 4. until you're at the end of the third period at which point you press 'End Game'
10. DON'T PRESS THE RESET BUTTON! :)
11. Take your phone to the person doing the gamesheet and show them the data.
12. Relish in the knowledge that you've done your bit to help the game happen! Well done you!

For the gamesheet filling-in-person:

This app tracks the shots on goal and, of those, which ones went in (displayed as S/G).
The gamesheet only requires you to enter how many shots on goal each goalie experienced in the game, not the goals.
So...
Just record the highest number in the in each period column for each goalie.
e.g.:
If the phone reads:

Team    Goalie    P1     P2    P3    Total
          #      S/G    S/G    S/G    Ice
Home      66     6/2    0/0    9/3    30:00


... the goalie recieved 6 shots in P1 (of which 2 were goals) and 9 shots in P3 (of which 3 were goals)
Remember: Each period the teams switched ends, so you have to get Goalie #66's P2 data from the other phones data.

once you've got all the shot data from both phones in the games sheet then just add up each goalie's Total Ice time and you're done!
